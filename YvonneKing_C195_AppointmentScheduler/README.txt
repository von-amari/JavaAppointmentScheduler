How to run the appointment scheduler:

The login screen will allow for users to log in to the application, and will display in English or 
in French, depending on the user's system language settings. 

The main appointment screen has options to add, modify, or cancel an appointment. All appointments 
in the main table are listed in the user's local system time. To add an appointment, click on the 
Add Appointment button. To modify or cancel, select a row, then press the Modify or Cancel 
Appointment buttons. 

The main appointment screen also has options to display appointments by month, week or all. These
options are at the top of the main table. Click the drop down to select a month, or click the "Next
7 Days" radio button for the week view. Finally, the "All" radio button allows users to view all
appointments. *Note - 7 day week view shows all appointments within a 168 hour window from the date 
and time user views the table. 

To navigate to the Customer View, click on the Customer button from the main appointment screen. 

In the Customer View, the user has options to modify, add, or delete customers. To add a customer, 
click on the Add Customer button. To modify or delete a customer, select the customer, then click
on the Delete or Modify Customer buttons. *Note - any appointments listed for a customer must be 
cancelled before the customer can be removed. 

The report button on the main appointment screen will navigate the user to a Reports main screen, 
which allows the user to choose from a Month and Type Report, Contact Report or Customer Report.
